                            I am a Software Engineer in my senior year of Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto.

                            I've paddled in Hungary in 2018 and will hopefully be on the Under24 Team Canada 2021 roster!

                                            The application was implented primarily in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. My contributions were in the form of application enhancements, performance improvements, and bug fixes. Most notably, I refactored the Javascipt and data handling to reduce application start-up times, as well as lessen computing time and input latency. Overall, there was a 25% performance improvement.

                                        <p>
                                            Our geographical information system (GIS), SimpleMaps, was a semester long project for the second year University of Toronto course ECE297: Design and Communication. The goal was to create an application to map major cities in the world using the OpenStreetMap database. In a group of three, we were to create the application and include as many features as time permitted. This project was a lot of fun as this was the first major project that I had created, and the amount of freedom given to us in terms of data structures and algorithms led to a lot of growth as a software engineer.
                                        </p>
                                        <h6>Implementation</h6>
                                        <p>
                                            The program was implemented in four stages to simplify the development process. The main objectives throughout this project was to make SimpleMaps minimalistic and responsive.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The first stage was to implement relevant basic functions, as well as define and initialize necessary data structures. Precautions were taken to minimize time complexity of these functions by selecting optimal data structures (ie. maps, unordered maps, tries, lists). In order to ensure SimpleMaps performance for the user, many data structures were initialized on application start which meant faster run time at the cost of higher memory consumption.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The second stage was to create the graphical user interface (GUI) using OpenGL as well as implement additional features. First we added natural features, building names, as well as street names and directions to the SimpleMaps GUI in familiar or intuitive colours. Following that, we added coloured-icon markers on the map for points of interest and added a search bar where the user can search for streets, intersections, points of interest, and even cities. The search bar was given added functionality by supporting fuzzy search, text-prediction, and auto-complete using tries.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The third stage was to implement a shortest-path algorithm to get from a starting location in SimpleMaps to an ending location. The goal of this step was to determine the most optimal route in terms of travel time and display this route in the SimpleMaps GUI. The shortest-path algorithm was implemented using a Dijkstra-A* hybrid. For searches from a specific location to a non-specific destination, SimpleMaps would use Dijkstra to return the closest destination matching the search criteria. For searches from a specific location to a specific destination, SimpleMaps would use A* to return the shortest path in terms of travel time to the unique destination. This hybrid algorithm resulted in run times 700% faster than the time limit provided by course instructors.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The final stage was to implement a solution to the travelling salesman problem, where there are 'packages' with a pickup and corresponding dropoff location. The goal of this step was to devise the most optimal route in terms of travel time for any given set of 'packages' in any city. The initial implementation was a modified greedy approach, where the algorithm would first pickup the nearest package, then either pickup another package or drop off a package depending on which was closest. Further implementations included 2-opt, multithreading, and simulated annealing to improve the algorithm. The final implementation was 300% faster than the initial greedy implementation and resulted in our team finishing 21st out of the 110 teams involved in the course.

                                        <p>
                                            Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a non-invasive rehabilitative technology used to produce artificial contractions in muscles. This technology has been used on individuals with incomplete spinal cord injuries (iSCI) to enable them to perform rehabilitative rowing exercise, which combines the voluntary movement of the upper body with stimulated movement of the lower body. FES is often activated manually by the user, who often require months to achieve effective rowing technique with accurate FES timing. With that in mind, the goal of this application was to develop a rowing coaching system that, in real time, displays instructions on when to administer FES.

                                        <p>
                                            In order to enable users to administer FES as well as monitor their force output, a Concept 2 rowing ergometer was attached with plate sensors, motion capture markers, and an FES trigger for user-administration of FES. The iSCI users would then have electrodes attached to their quadriceps and hamstring muscles, the muscles in which the FES would induce contraction.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The front end of this application was created using Python and PyQT5 to create the graphical user interface (GUI). The application was designed to be as intuitive as possible for the user and lower the technical barrier of entry typically associated with rowing. Users were able to set exercise parametrs and then visual as well as audio queues would be given to notify the user when to administer FES.

                                            Data acquisition was done using a National Instruments Data Acquisition Unit  (NI DAQ). This DAQ was connected the rowing ergometer to the application and analyzed user-administered FES timing. Based on the analysis, feedback would be given to the user.

                                        <p>
                                            As part of the internal 2019 407 ETR Summer Hackathon, my team wanted to address an existing gap in the 407 ETR's services. With the release of the 407 ETR mobile app, the company wanted as many 407 ETR users to have the app as possible. We recognized that many customers would likely not feel the need to download the new app. If they were able to get by without the mobile app thus far, they may feel the tedious onboarding process associated with downloading a new app is not worth it. In other words, after a long time without an app, it would be difficult to overcome the intertia and develop new habits just for using the 407 ETR's services. To address this, we decided to implement a smart chat bot that would act as a lighter version of the 407 ETR app, providing services the user may find useful and acting as a gateway to downloading the mobile app. The team analyzed most commonly used messenging apps and discovered that Facebook Mesenger was the most commonly used messeging app among North Americans.

                                        <p>
                                            This chat bot is a smart chat bot integrated with Facebook Messenger that notifies customers of the 407 ETR of account details and real time statistics such as accidents, congestion, trip capture status, and billing information. Bot would use AI to record customer’s regular trips and, using live information, inform user to leave earlier or later than usual depending on live highway status and weather.

                                        <p>
                                            This application was implemented using Python and Facebook Messenger API, which communicated to existing 407 ETR APIs to link user messenger accounts to their 407 ETR transponder or license plate.
